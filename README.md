My Udemy full-stack bootcamp course project.

It's my first time to get to learn web technologies and days after I started it, I realized that web development was my thing.
I clicked with Node.js and it's now my favourite backend language. 

**Frontend**: EJS template.

**Backend**: Node.js, Express.js. MongoDB, Passport-local strategy authentication.
